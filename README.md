# Introduction: 
The angry-swabs repository holds the datasets and R Markdowns required to replicate the data analysis and data visualization generated in *Comparable specimen collection from both ends of at-home mid-turbinate swabs*. 

There are four data analytics of interest are: 
1. Failure Rates 
2. Human RNAse P CRT Values 
3. RedCap Partipants' Information (confidence and discomfort on nasal collection, age, sex, income)
4. Pathogen Detection Rates

Each of these data analytics includes the dataset itself and an R Markdown file that can be used as a guide to generate the data analysis and data visualization via R or R Studio.
