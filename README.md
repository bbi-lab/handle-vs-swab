# Abstract: 
**Importance**:  Unsupervised upper respiratory specimen collection is a key factor in the ability to massively scale up SARS-CoV-2 testing. But there is concern that unsupervised specimen collection may produce inferior samples.

**Objective**:  Across two studies that instructed participants to collect a mid-turbinate nasal specimens at home that some used the wrong end of the swab. We sought to understand if those incorrectly collected specimens were of sufficient quality for pathogen detection and which demographic covariates were associated with deviation from the instructions.

**Design:**  Individuals with and without symptoms of an acute respiratory infection from across the Seattle metropolitan area could participate in the Seattle Flu Study’s ‘Swab and Send’ program and greater Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) through on-line registration. The 12,175 at-home collected specimens from participants returned to the laboratory were inspected for adherence to the test kit instructions and screened for 24 respiratory pathogens by RT-PCR.

**Results:** We found that 107 of 12,175 (0.9%) specimens were returned to the lab with the swab handle in the transport media instead of the swab. The human marker RNase P and respiratory pathogens were detected at indistinguishable rates from the erroneously collected specimens. Older participants were more likely to deviate from instructions and use the swab handle.
Conclusions and Relevance: Our data show that molecular testing for respiratory pathogens is robust to mistakes made by individuals collecting mid-turbinate specimens at home.

# Organization:
The repository holds the datasets and R Markdowns required to replicate the data analysis and data visualization generated in *Comparable specimen collection from both ends of at-home mid-turbinate swabs*. 

There are four data analytics of interest are: 
1. Failure Rates 
2. Human RNAse P CRT Values 
3. RedCap Participants' Information (confidence and discomfort on nasal collection, age, sex, income)
4. Pathogen Detection Rates

Each of these data analytics includes the dataset itself and an R Markdown pdf file that can be used as a guide to generate the data analysis and data visualization via R or R Studio.

* `datasets`: Contains the collection of datasets used for any of the four data analytics 
* Figure 1.B and 1.C are generated from the Human RNAse P CRT Values 
* Figure 2.A, 2.B, and 2.C are generated from Redcap Participants' Information
* Table is generated from Pathogen Detection Rates
